<!--
The aim of this document is to provide a common glossary for the methods, which will help with:
- Consistency of the language across methods
- Consistency of definitions across methods
- Aligning vocabulary among practictionners of the alliance in common discussions

The following drawbacks will need to be mitigated:
- Methods would need to be self-contained at time of approval, so there's a need to copy-paste definitions from here into the method at that time

-->

# Glossary

The following definitions apply to all usages of the following terms (including their plural forms) in the methodologies:

- **Baseline** refers to a counterfactual situation where the intervention described in the methodology did not happen.

- **Digital certificate** is a generic term designating environmental attributes in digital form generated using a methodology, which will correspond to Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs).

- **Site** refers to a geographically delimited facility where the assets covered by the methodology are located. Examples of this are a building and an energy production facility.

# Normative language

The methodologies make use of the following wordings to distinguish between requirements, recommendations and options (accordingly with common standardisation practices):
- **shall** indicates a *requirement*,
- **should** indicates a *recommendation*,
- **may** indicates an *option* that is permitted.
